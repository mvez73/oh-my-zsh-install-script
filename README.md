# zsh, oh my zsh and powerlevel10k install script
This script will install zsh, oh my zsh + the plugins you choose and the theme powerlevel10k.
It will also detect your Linux distro to use the correct package manager to install git if necessary. Fastfetch can be install if you have Debian/Ubuntu. (More distro to come)

## How to install

 1. In your home directory, use Nano (or Vim) to create a file named install.sh.
`$ nano install.sh` (Do not use sudo) and paste the content of the script in that new file.
 2. Save the file.
 3. Now simply type `$ bash install.sh`
 4. If git is not installed, the script will ask you if you want to install it. Type ***y*** or ***yes*** to install git.
